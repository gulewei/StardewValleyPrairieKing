# **Prairie King: Outlaw Starter Kit** 
A clean mod that gives you power-ups the moment you step into the boots of the Prairie King.


## ✨ The Starter Kit

⚡ Speed Boost (Coffee): Start with increased movement speed. Outrun the fastest monsters and weave through bullet patterns with ease.

🎡 Wagon Wheel (8-Way Shot): Your gun fires in all 8 directions at once! This creates a 360-degree "no-fly zone" around your character, allowing you to dominate the map.

⏳ Persistent Power: Buff timers are extended (1000x duration), meaning you don't have to rush. Your starter buffs—and any you pick up—will last for the duration of the stage.

## 💡 Important Tips & Mechanics
To keep the mod lightweight and balanced, please keep these two rules in mind:

🕹️ Saloon Exclusive: This mod is specifically designed for the Stardrop Saloon arcade machine. Head to the saloon to activate your power-ups!

💀 Death Resets the Buffs: These starting items are a "gift for the living." If you lose a life and respawn, your starting buffs will expire. You'll need to rely on your skill (and any permanent shop upgrades you've bought) to finish the stage!

🏆 Achievement Friendly: This is the perfect companion for players chasing the Fector's Challenge achievement. It provides the early-game advantage needed to farm coins safely.
